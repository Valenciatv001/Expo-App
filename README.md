### Cloning the Repository:

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

### Installing Dependencies:

4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the project was cloned.

5. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary Node.js packages specified in the `package.json` file.

### Starting the Expo App:

6. After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo DevTools.

7. In the terminal, you'll see a QR code. Scan this QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to preview the app.

   Alternatively, you can press `a` to open the app in an Android emulator or `i` to open it in an iOS simulator if you have them set up.

That's it! Your friend should now be able to clone, install dependencies, and start your Expo app. If there are any specific instructions or configurations needed for your app, make sure to include them in your documentation.
